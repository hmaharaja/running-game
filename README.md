# running-game

Just a simple FPGA-based game written in verilog. Choose your difficulty level, and that increases the speed of the clock accorddingly, as well as the types of randomized objects that can come at you. This game makes your character run for as long as you can without either hitting the randomized objects, or falling through a hole. Your score is based on the number of obstacles you successfully bypass, rather than a clock timer. 

We based it on the classic format of infinite runner games, with a bit of a retro theme to it. Designed to run on a 320x240 resolution VGA.
